# twilio-messaging-and-calls
A repo for utilizing the Twilio messaging API and Twilio voice call API to send text messages with send_message.py and make_call.py.

src folder contains 2 seperate programs. 1 for sending text messages and 1 for making phone calls.
The substance of the code for both programs is contained inside the mypackage folder.

create_message.py and create_call.py must be modified with your twilio account information and the numbers you wish to send a message to and call must be added.

both programs require the twilio python package.
